# Numerical-Modeling-of-Engineering-Problems


## Description

This repository contains MATLAB code developed to solve four distinct problems related to a customized center-pivot irrigation system. The aim is to apply numerical techniques to model this engineering system involving fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics and heat transfer.
The numerical methods employed include the following topics:

Solution of systems of linear algebraic equations, interpolation, curve fitting, root finding, numerical differentiation and finite differencing, integration, and the solution of initial and boundary value problems.
